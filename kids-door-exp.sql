Work to analyse kids door experiment ticket DATAFORCE-562
1. Find the visits in the experiment and label them as control or variant.
2. Identify these user's IDs. For the control group only select their FIRST visit. This will match the variant group only being considered on the first visit.
3. Only select each users FIRST visit. For variant this is the only time they saw the door. This need to be matched for the control.
4. For variant group
    a. How many saw the door
    b. How many clicked adult, kids or left.
5. Split the variant into two group: kids or adult door chosen. This now gives three groups: control, variant_kids, variant_adult.
6. Link the visits to the journey start/watched table
    a. Categorise their viewing as kids/adult
    b. Count number of starts and watched that were adult content and that were kids content. (kids defined as CBBC/Cbeebies masterbrand)
7. Look at the difference in user numbers across the three variants. If the groups are uneven sampling may need to be done. Consult E&O (Frank on holiday) about this.
8. Analysis across variants
    a. visit_id, exp_group, number of STARTS to KIDS content - per browser statistical significance and uplift using R package.
    b. visit_id, exp_group, number of COMPLETES to KIDS content - per browser statistical significance and uplift using R package.
    c. visit_id, exp_group, number of STARTS to ADULT content - per browser statistical significance and uplift using R package.
    b. visit_id, exp_group, number of COMPLETES to ADULT content - per browser statistical significance and uplift using R package.
